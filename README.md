# DATA_STRUCTURE_ALGORITHMS
Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. It is designed to help developers, both beginners and experienced, build a solid foundation in C++ programming while exploring key concepts in DSA.

Structure
C++ Basics

Introduction to C++: Overview of the C++ programming language, its history, and why it's widely used in system programming, game development, and competitive programming.
Setup and Installation: Step-by-step guide to setting up a C++ development environment using popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or online compilers.
Basic Syntax: Introduction to basic C++ syntax, including variables, data types, operators, and control flow (if-else, loops).
Functions: Understanding functions in C++, including function declaration, definition, and calling functions.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Overview of OOP principles in C++, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
File Handling: Basics of file operations in C++â€”reading from and writing to files.
Data Structures

Arrays: Introduction to arrays, their structure, and basic operations such as traversal, insertion, and deletion.
Linked Lists: Overview of singly and doubly linked lists, including creation, traversal, insertion, and deletion.
Stacks and Queues: Understanding stack and queue data structures, their operations, and applications.
Trees: Detailed explanation of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and tree traversal techniques (inorder, preorder, postorder).
Graphs: Introduction to graphs, graph representation (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), and basic graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).
Hashing: Explanation of hash tables, hashing techniques, and collision resolution strategies.
Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms: Detailed coverage of various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and their time complexity analysis.
